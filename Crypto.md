1.  ROTATOR


There's a cipher Here

Analyzing with cyberchef shows that it's encoded In ROT 

Decoding it reveal the flag

2. AS WE ALL KNOW 


this looks like a Base64 let's decode that.

3.  SOMETHING NEW 


This also looks like a base64 encoding but decoding with base64 dosen't reveal the flag 
sseems they are using some old scarce base let's try base 68

4.  ROTATOR REFUELED


Another encoded text agin Let's try to analyze it. This is another ROT cipher but but this time it's ROT_47 cipher Let's decode with ROT_47

5. UNLIKE POPULAR OPINION 


This is another Base Let's try out Base64 & 58. but they dont reveal our flag.
try Google na abi LOOOOOL. oh seems they love base encoding here Let's try analyze it 
so it's Base32 not 64 and 58 
play with cyberchef and make google your friend they both help me here....

6. YET AGAIN 


There's a lot to decode here today  LOOOL......

play with cyberchef and google again you will found out that it's encoded in ASCII 58 

let's decode that straight up no dull am before another player score before us.....
